# Free Games Newsletter mailer

This is the repository for the [Free Games Newsletter](https://www.freegamesnewsletter.tech/) mailer service. It is the microservice responsible to send all the emails in the newsletter, including both confirmation emails and the newsletter itself.

## What is the Newsletter
**Free Games Newsletter** sends you an email when a game is free-to-keep for a limited time on Steam. 

I had this idea after being frustrated about losing many free games because Steam doesn't publish on its front page when a game is free-to-keep.
